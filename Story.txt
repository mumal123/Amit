A Lost identity!
When Amit woke up in the morning and looked at his face in the mirror, he did not recognise the face looking back at him. ‘This is not me………… ‘ he cried aloud. The face staring at him was calm and cool. Amit moved his fingers on the surface of the mirror. It felt different. He touched his face. It appeared strange and was like touching someone else’s face. He felt scared and anxious. Where was his face? What had happened? He tried to recall the last evening’s events and could hardly remember anything. He opened the door of his room where another shock awaited him. He noticed some people in his house who seemed to be like his parents, grandparents and sister but everybody had the same face, the face he now shared with them.
He tried hard to remember what he had been doing the previous night. Yes, he remembered he had been reading a book ‘The Alien visits Home’. It was an old book that was kept in the attic. There were some magical words in the book which he had chanted loudly. He quickly looked for the book, opened it and tried hard to find those magical words. He also found the words which undid the effect of the words he had spoken the previous night. He muttered the words and with a loud whoosh sound he was shaken up and fell unconscious on the floor. When he opened his eyes he was lying on his bed. He quickly got up and ran towards the mirror. It was his original face, his own.
